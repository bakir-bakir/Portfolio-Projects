Title: Exploratory Data Analysis of Netflix Content Dataset
Tools Used: Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)

Description:
In this data analysis project, we dive into a comprehensive dataset that contains information about Netflix movies, TV shows, genres, directors, ratings, and more.
Using Python's powerful data analysis libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, we explore, format, analyze, and visualize the data to gain
meaningful insights into the world of Netflix content.

The project encompasses the following key steps:

Data Formatting and Cleaning: Initially, we load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and perform necessary data formatting and cleaning operations. This involves
handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring consistency in data types and formats. By transforming the dataset into a clean and structured format,
we lay the groundwork for subsequent analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis: With the formatted dataset, we conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain a better understanding of the Netflix content landscape.
We analyze various aspects such as the distribution of movies and TV shows, genres, release years, directors, and ratings. This EDA phase helps identify trends, patterns, and interesting insights within the dataset.

Data Analysis and Insights: Leveraging the capabilities of Pandas, NumPy, and other Python libraries, we perform deeper analysis to uncover key insights. We
explore relationships between variables, such as the correlation between ratings and genres or the distribution of directors across different genres. We also
analyze the distribution of content by release year and explore any notable trends or patterns.

Data Visualization: To effectively communicate the findings, we create visualizations using Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visual representations include bar plots,
line charts, histograms, and heatmaps, among others. Through compelling visuals, we highlight the distribution of content, showcase trends, and convey key insights
discovered during the analysis phase.

By leveraging the power of Python and its data analysis libraries, we uncover valuable insights about Netflix movies and TV shows. This project provides a
comprehensive view of the content landscape, shedding light on trends, popular genres, director contributions, and rating distributions. The visualizations enhance the understanding of the data and facilitate effective communication of the findings.
