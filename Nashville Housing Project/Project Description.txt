Description:
In this data cleaning project, we focus on a Nashville housing dataset to ensure data quality, consistency, and integrity using SQL Server.
The project aims to prepare the dataset for further analysis and modeling by addressing common data quality issues and cleaning up inconsistencies.

The dataset used for this project comprises housing-related information from various sources, including property listings, sales records,
and demographic data specific to Nashville, Tennessee. It includes attributes such as property addresses, sale prices, square footage, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and other relevant features.

The project involves several key steps:

1.Data Import: Import the raw dataset into SQL Server, ensuring that the data is correctly formatted and loaded into appropriate tables.

2.Data Exploration: Conduct an initial exploration of the dataset to gain a deeper understanding of its structure, content, and potential data quality issues. Identify potential inconsistencies, missing values, outliers, or anomalies that need to be addressed.

3.Data Cleaning and Transformation: Apply a range of data cleaning techniques to improve the dataset's quality and consistency, such as:

4.Removing duplicates: Identify and eliminate duplicate records from the dataset to avoid redundancies and ensure data accuracy.

5.Handling missing values: Assess the extent of missing values across different attributes and employ strategies like imputation or deletion, based on the nature and impact of the missingness.

6.Standardizing formats: Standardize and format data fields like addresses, phone numbers, and dates to ensure consistency and facilitate further analysis.

7.Correcting inconsistencies: Identify and rectify inconsistencies in attribute values, such as erroneous entries, misspellings, or conflicting information.

8.Validating data integrity: Implement data integrity checks and constraints to ensure that the data adheres to defined rules and constraints.
